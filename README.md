# Introduction
Hi, I'm Quay â€” most people call me Kain. I am a designer and developer utilizing my gifts in creative thinking and problem solving to create awareness and access for communities. 

I have multiple talents but the common theme is design. I started manipulating HTML code in MySpace (when that was a thing, sorry if you're born before 2000 :/) and from there I began designing banners on Photoshop and I've been going every since. I have a series of experiences that make my eye for creativity and design thinking unique. I am composed of many things, and those things make me who I am. I utilize those traumas, those experiences, and those thoughts for human-centered design.  

I am an INTJ, meaning I am a mastermind (they say), and design is the perfect outlet for expression. I look to creativity as the outlet for my genius. I am now looking for design/development roles in UI and ultimately I would like to get into UX design to really create processes and experiences for users focused on listening, empathy, and great design. What are you losing in your bottom line because your users or customers aren't having their needs met? What opportunities are you missing out on from design that doesn't connect, or design that isn't needed due to a lack of understanding of your community? 

Questions, I'd love to talk through.
